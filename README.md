# Computer-Networks-Project_Internet-Radio

In this project it includes multicasting of data in the form of multimedia over internet protocol. It is an application for internet radio. As we know in radio a large number of users tune in to particular station out of all the available stations at time and similarly in the project there is Any Source Multicast model (ASM) where to identify multiple messages from multiple sender, multiple group address is used and so more than one sender can be a part of same group. The other point is like in radio the user can exit or change the stations in an actual radio at any time, our client and server provides the similar functionality to the user as the connection of sockets is initially done using transmission control protocol (TCP) which establishes the control channel and then later multimedia is sent using datagram protocol (UDP) socket as it is more efficient for the multicast type of transmission. Therefore, in all it implements one to many multicasts several times.
